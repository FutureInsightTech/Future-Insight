<p>The world is changing rapidly. With the rise of AI and advancements in computing power, establishing a secure internet connection has become increasingly challenging. The vastness of the internet allows for access to a wide range of information, but it also poses risks. If one is not cautious, personal information can be sold online. Various organizations track your online activities, creating profiles that are used to deliver targeted advertisements. Additionally, the threat of viruses looms, capable of compromising your system and resulting in the loss of valuable data.</p>
<p>Therefore, the question arises: How can you safeguard your operating system from viruses, data theft, and other potential dangers? Fear not, for I will provide an explanation on everything you need to secure your computer or laptop, ensuring the protection of your digital world.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways you can secure your computer. In this blog, we will go through how to secure Windows 10 or Windows 11.</p>
<h1 id="windows">Windows</h1>
<p>Windows 11 was released a while ago with its main selling point being enhanced security. However, I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced about its level of security. While Windows is great for various tasks, it does have certain limitations when it comes to protecting your private data and defending against different types of attacks.
Even after years of development, Windows 10 still exhibits some security issues. Moreover, Windows has a tendency to collect a significant amount of user data during installation.</p>
<h1 id="windows-security">Windows Security</h1>
<p>When it comes to securing Windows, follow these steps in the specified order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Latest Security Patches.</li>
<li>Enable Firewall.</li>
<li>Enable Windows security features.</li>
<li>Add Password/Biometric authentication.</li>
<li>Encrypt Disk.</li>
<li>Backup your system.</li>
<li>Debloat Windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can ensure better security and privacy for your Windows computer.</p>
<h2 id="security-patches">Security Patches</h2>
<p>A security patch in the context of Windows refers to an update or fix provided by Microsoft to address known vulnerabilities or security issues in the operating system. These patches play a critical role in maintaining the security and integrity of your Windows system.</p>
<p>Security patches are released by Microsoft on a regular basis, typically in the form of Windows Updates. These updates are designed to close security loopholes, fix software bugs, and improve overall system stability. By applying these patches, you ensure that your operating system has the latest security enhancements and protection against potential threats.</p>
<p>The importance of installing security patches cannot be overstated. Neglecting to update your system leaves it vulnerable to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities. Hackers and cybercriminals often target unpatched systems, taking advantage of these security gaps to gain unauthorized access, compromise data, or disrupt operations.</p>
<p>Microsoft continuously monitors and analyzes potential security risks to identify vulnerabilities in their software. Once a vulnerability is identified, the company develops a corresponding security patch to address the issue. These patches are thoroughly tested to ensure compatibility and stability before they are made available to users.</p>
<p>To keep your Windows system secure, it is crucial to stay up to date with the latest security patches. You can configure your system to automatically download and install Windows Updates or manually check for updates on a regular basis. By doing so, you protect your computer from known security vulnerabilities and benefit from the ongoing efforts of Microsoft to maintain the security of their operating system.</p>
<p>Remember that security patches alone are not enough to guarantee absolute security. It is equally important to implement other security measures, such as using robust passwords, employing antivirus software, practicing safe browsing habits, and regularly backing up your data. Together, these practices form a comprehensive approach to safeguarding your Windows system and protecting your digital assets.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-firewall">Enabling Firewall</h2>
<p>A firewall is a simple yet powerful tool that helps protect your computer and all its valuable information.
It acts as a digital shield, standing guard between your device and the vast sea of online threats.
This robust guardian keeps a watchful eye on the traffic flowing in and out, ensuring that only authorized and safe data gets through while malicious intruders are kept at bay.
By analyzing and filtering data packets based on specific rules, the firewall acts as a gatekeeper, safeguarding your precious files and personal data from hackers, viruses, and other cyber-attacks. It&rsquo;s like having a vigilant security guard for your digital fortress, giving you peace of mind and a solid defense against online dangers.</p>
<p>A firewall is like the bouncer of network security, keeping the bad guys out and letting the good stuff in. It&rsquo;s a vital shield between a company&rsquo;s internal network and all the sketchy stuff out there. This cyber-guardian watches the traffic coming and going, using some cool rules to decide who gets in and who gets kicked to the curb. By examining data packets and checking their source, destination, and content, firewalls can stop hackers, malware, and all sorts of troublemakers from messing with your network. They&rsquo;re like the ultimate bodyguards, filtering out the bad while allowing the legit stuff to flow freely. Firewalls can be either hardware or software, but either way, they&rsquo;re your trusty defenders, making sure your precious data stays safe and sound.</p>
<h3 id="enable-firewall-on-window-10">Enable Firewall on Window 10</h3>

</li>
<li>
<p>Under the &ldquo;Firewall &amp; network protection&rdquo; section, you will see your active network connections. Click on the network you want to enable the firewall for (e.g., &ldquo;Private network&rdquo;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the next screen, you will find the Windows Defender Firewall settings for that specific network. Ensure that the &ldquo;Windows Defender Firewall&rdquo; toggle switch is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also customize the firewall settings by clicking on &ldquo;Allow an app through firewall&rdquo; or &ldquo;Advanced settings&rdquo; on the same page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you will successfully enable the firewall on your Windows 10 computer, providing an added layer of protection against unauthorized access and potential security threats.</p>
<h3 id="firewall-on-window-11">Firewall on Window 11</h3>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the Windows Security or Defender Security Center window, you should see an indication that the firewall is active and protecting your system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the firewall is not enabled, you can typically activate it by going to the &ldquo;Firewall &amp; network protection&rdquo; or similar section within the app and following the prompts to turn on the firewall.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="adding-password-to-account">Adding Password to Account</h2>
<p>In my experience, it&rsquo;s essential to always protect your computer with strong passwords. If, unfortunately, your computer gets lost or stolen, having a password in place adds an extra layer of security. In such cases, the thief would need to reset your computer, which would result in the erasure of all your personal files. This added protection acts as a safeguard, ensuring that even if your device falls into the wrong hands, your sensitive information remains inaccessible. Remember to choose passwords that are unique, complex, and not easily guessable to maximize the effectiveness of this security measure.</p>
<p>To add a password or PIN to your account in Windows 10, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>

<h2 id="encrypt-disk">Encrypt Disk</h2>
<p>Disk encryption is a powerful security measure that helps protect your sensitive data from unauthorized access.
By encrypting a disk, you scramble its contents, making them unreadable without the appropriate decryption key or password.
This ensures that even if your disk falls into the wrong hands, the data stored on it remains secure and inaccessible.
Windows 10 provides a convenient built-in tool called BitLocker, allowing you to encrypt your disks effortlessly.
Whether it&rsquo;s an external hard drive, USB flash drive, or even your computer&rsquo;s internal drive, encrypting the disk with BitLocker adds an additional layer of protection, giving you peace of mind that your confidential information remains confidential.</p>
<h3 id="encrypt-disk-on-window-10">Encrypt Disk on Window 10</h3>
<p>To encrypt a disk in Windows 10, you can use the built-in feature called BitLocker. Here&rsquo;s how you can encrypt a disk using BitLocker:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Connect the disk you want to encrypt to your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open File Explorer by clicking on the folder icon in the taskbar or by pressing the Windows key + E.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click on the disk you want to encrypt and select &ldquo;Turn on BitLocker.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If BitLocker prompts you for permission, click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the BitLocker setup wizard, select &ldquo;Use a password to unlock the drive.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a strong password that meets the complexity requirements. Make sure to remember or securely store this password, as it is required to unlock the encrypted disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a method to back up your recovery key. You can either save it to a file, print it, or save it to your Microsoft account. This recovery key is essential if you forget your password or need to access the encrypted disk from another computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the encryption method. The recommended option is &ldquo;Encrypt entire drive,&rdquo; which encrypts all the existing and future files on the disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click &ldquo;Start encrypting&rdquo; to begin the encryption process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The encryption process may take some time, depending on the size of the disk. You can continue to use your computer during the encryption, but it may affect performance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the encryption process is complete, your disk will be protected by BitLocker. Each time you connect the encrypted disk to your computer, you will need to enter the password you set earlier to unlock and access the data on the disk.</p>
<h2 id="backup-your-system">Backup your system</h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>Configure backup settings: Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a backup method or software, configure the settings accordingly. This includes selecting the specific files and folders to include in the backup, setting up encryption if desired, and specifying the backup destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the initial backup: Start the initial backup process, which may take some time depending on the size of your data. This first backup ensures that all your important files are securely saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test your backups: Regularly verify the integrity of your backups by restoring some files or data from the backup. This will help ensure that your backups are functioning correctly and that you can successfully retrieve your data if needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps and maintaining a regular backup routine, you can safeguard your system and data against unforeseen events and have peace of mind knowing that your valuable files are protected.</p>
