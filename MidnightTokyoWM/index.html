            <hr>
<p>Linux has become an integral part of my daily computing routine. I find immense joy in using it, and there is no doubt that it has transformed my computing experience. I embarked on my Linux journey approximately three years ago, and since then, I have explored a multitude of distributions, seeking to understand what makes each one tick and what sets them apart. Some have proven to be less than satisfactory, while others have truly impressed me.</p>
<p>My first foray into the Linux world began with Ubuntu, a distribution that introduced me to the open-source software ecosystem. From there, I ventured into the realms of Zorin, Manjaro, Arch, and Debian, eager to uncover the unique offerings of each. However, it was during my experiences with Arch Linux and Debian that I discovered the enchanting realm of window managers.</p>
<p>Intrigued by the allure of customization and personalization, I delved into various window managers, exploring their capabilities and transforming them into full-fledged desktop environments. This journey proved to be both challenging and rewarding as I acquired the skills to configure and tailor these window managers to suit my preferences.</p>
<p>Although I have experimented with different distributions, I have yet to find the perfect desktop environment that truly inspires me and enhances my workflow. While options like Gnome and Plasma are undoubtedly excellent, they can sometimes feel monotonous. I yearned for something unique and captivating. This led me on a path to discover alternative solutions, specifically window managers.</p>
<p>My quest to find an exceptional window manager introduced me to a myriad of options, each with its own distinct appeal. After thorough exploration, I eventually settled on the Awesome Window Manager. Its innovative design, flexibility, and seamless workflow integration captivated me and transformed my Linux experience.</p>
<p>Through my continuous exploration of Linux and its vast possibilities, I have not only found a reliable operating system but also discovered a passion for customization and personalization. It is this journey of constant discovery and adaptation that fuels my love for Linux and motivates me to share my experiences with others.</p>
<h1 id="my-desktop-environment">My Desktop Environment</h1>
<p>For my ideal desktop environment, I have chosen to use the Awesome Window Manager alongside a curated selection of applications and extensions. With each iteration and version of my desktop environment, I have come closer to achieving the perfect balance, but the journey of customization and refinement is never truly complete. There is always an urge to tweak or change something, seeking that next level of personalization.</p>
<p>The current version of my desktop environment, however, represents a significant milestone in my pursuit of the perfect setup. The combination of the Awesome Window Manager with carefully chosen applications and extensions has culminated in a highly productive and visually pleasing environment. The window tiling and management capabilities of Awesome, along with its extensibility, provide a seamless and efficient workflow.</p>
<p>To complement the Awesome Window Manager, I have handpicked a suite of applications and extensions that perfectly align with my needs and preferences. From productivity tools to system utilities, each application serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall functionality and aesthetics of my desktop environment.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the quest for the perfect desktop environment is an ongoing endeavor. As technology evolves and personal preferences shift, there will always be room for exploration and improvement. The flexibility and adaptability of Linux allow me to continue refining and tailoring my setup, ensuring that it remains an extension of my workflow and creativity.</p>
<h1 id="look--feel">Look &amp; Feel</h1>
<p>At the time of writing this blog post, my desktop environment look like this, but with time I will be tweaking and making it better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Desktop View

<li>Tilting View

<li>Multiple Terminal
<img src="/images/2023/my-new-desktop/multiple-terminal-look.png" alt="multiple-terminal"></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="programming-language">Programming Language</h1>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, creating a custom desktop environment does not necessarily require proficiency in a programming language. Instead, it primarily involves a solid understanding of how to read and modify existing code to align with your specific requirements. In the realm of window managers, Lua emerges as a scripting language of choice, offering an elegant and efficient solution for customization.</p>
<p>The Awesome Window Manager, being highly configurable, is designed and coded using Lua, making it a powerful and versatile tool for shaping your desktop environment. Lua&rsquo;s scripting capabilities enable seamless interaction with the system through the utilization of functions and libraries. As a result, the configuration files that govern the behavior and appearance of the window manager are written and tailored in the Lua programming language.</p>
<p>By leveraging Lua, you gain the ability to fine-tune and personalize your desktop environment to an extraordinary extent. The intuitive syntax and extensive documentation make Lua accessible for both beginners and experienced users, facilitating the customization process and enabling you to shape your desktop environment according to your unique workflow and preferences.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Lua ecosystem encompasses a rich collection of libraries and modules, offering additional functionalities and extending the capabilities of the Awesome Window Manager. This ecosystem provides a vast array of options to further enhance and refine your desktop environment, ensuring a seamless integration of applications, extensions, and utilities.</p>

<p>This is the folder structure so for the awesome Window manager.</p>
