# Development:
If you want to help develop this website or contribute with me, please do so; however, before you begin development, you must first complete the following steps:

## Process:
Follow the instructions.
### Version & Branch:
    1. No code will be committed to the main branch without the project administrator's testing and approval.
    2. In order to contribute create a branch from the main branch, the name of the branch should be the feature that you are working on. 
    3. Every Branch will represent a single major release or version of the project.
    4. Once the Version is complete, the branch will go into lock mode, No development will be performed on that specific branch.
### Testing & Documentation:
    5. Every commit needs to be documented; if not, it won't be accepted.
    6. Every commit needs to be tested; if not, it won't be accepted.
