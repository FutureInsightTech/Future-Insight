# Development:
If you want to help develop this website or contribute with me, please do so; however, before you begin development, you must first complete the following steps:


1. No code will be committed to the main branch without the project administrator's testing and approval.
2. All of the commits will be accepted in the [Development-Branch](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Blog-website/tree/Development-Branch).
3. Every commitment needs to be documented; if not, it won't be accepted.
4. Every commitment needs to be tested; if not, it won't be accepted.
