If you want to help develop this website or contribute with me, please follow the instructions below:

## Process
1. No code will be committed to the main branch without the project administrator's testing and approval.
2. To contribute, switch to the Development-Branch and make all changes in that branch. Once you are sure the code is tested and working fine, you can create a pull request to the main branch.
3. Switch to the Development Branch using the following command:
    ```bash
    git checkout Development-Branch
    ```
4. When a feature is finalized, create a new branch from the development branch. This branch will represent a specific version (e.g., Version-4).
5. The new branch will be merged with the main branch, and the old branch will be locked. No code should ever be committed to the old branch.
6. Every commit you make should have proper documentation. Include timestamps to make it easy to track changes.
7. Every commit you make should be properly tested. Include timestamps to make it easy to track testing.

### Testing & Documentation
8. Pull requests without any commits will be rejected.
9. Pull requests without proper testing will be rejected.
