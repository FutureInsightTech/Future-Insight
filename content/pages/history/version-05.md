## 6.  Adding Animation to the entire website 
Introduce subtle and tasteful animations throughout the website to enhance the user experience. Consider animations like fade-ins, smooth transitions, and interactive effects to engage visitors and guide their attention. However, ensure that animations are used judiciously, without overwhelming the content or affecting the website's performance negatively.

## 7.  Removing the old comment system called "Disqus" 
Eliminate the outdated Disqus comment system from the website to declutter and streamline the codebase. Remove all related code snippets, configurations, and dependencies to maintain a clean and efficient website.

Plus, this service was collecting data from the user side and making the website slower, and the author was not able to get notification if the user had commented or not, so unfortunately, we have removed it, but we are adding a new service that is open source and makes the website much better.

## 8.  Adding a new Comments section linked to GitHub Issues
Implement a new comments section that integrates with GitHub Issues, allowing visitors to leave feedback, suggestions, or bug reports. This enables a seamless integration with the project's development and issue tracking workflow, making it easier to manage and address user feedback effectively.

## 9. Updating all blogs with animations
Apply consistent animation styles to all blog posts to enhance the overall visual appeal and user engagement. Utilize animations to highlight key points, reveal content gradually, or add visual interest to the reading experience. Ensure that animations are purposeful and do not distract from the main message of the blog posts.

## 10. Removing all unused files 
Regularly review and clean up the website's file structure, removing any unnecessary or unused files. This helps improve the website's performance, reduces complexity, and makes maintenance easier. Ensure that all removed files are safely backed up and do not impact any essential functionality.

## 11. Refactoring old code into new code
Rewrite and restructure any outdated or deprecated code to enhance its quality, readability, and maintainability. Follow best coding practices, modularize the codebase, and use clear naming conventions to improve organization and make future updates more efficient.

## 12. Adding a favicon to the website
Create a favicon that represents the website's brand or logo. The favicon should be visually appealing and easily recognizable, improving the website's identity and user experience.

## 13. Updating the config file and changing the code section color with lightroom 
Review and update the website's configuration file to reflect any changes made during the redesign process. Additionally, consider changing the color scheme of the code sections to a lighter tone using tools like lightroom, ensuring better readability and a more pleasing visual experience.

Remember to thoroughly test all the changes to ensure they work seamlessly across different devices and browsers. Continuously gather user feedback to refine and improve the website further.
