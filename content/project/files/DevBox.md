DevBox is a script that simplifies the process of setting up a Linux system for development purposes. As a developer, you may find it tedious and time-consuming to configure a new Linux system for development, but with DevBox, you can automate this process. The script is designed to install and configure all the necessary applications and tools that a developer would need to get started quickly. With support for Debian and Arch Linux, DevBox is versatile and can be used on multiple systems. It does not use Snap Pack, ensuring a fast and streamlined installation process. Once the script is executed, you can forget about the installation and focus on your work. DevBox supports AUR and can also be used to theme Gnome desktops. With Git and GitHub configuration, DevBox streamlines the development process. The script is secure, and with its one-line command line execution, it is easy to use even for beginners.

# About Application:
So the application has 5 different versions, and each version has a unique file structure, permissions, and supports different applications. This means that each version is very different from the others, and requires a different approach to work with. So it's important to understand which version you're working with and what its specific requirements are, in order to effectively use the application.

# Key Features of the Linux System Configuration Script:
Here are some of the features of DevBox:

## NO Use of Snap Pack
DevBox does not rely on Snap Packs, which can sometimes cause compatibility issues or performance problems. Instead, DevBox uses the default package manager of your distribution to install the necessary packages and dependencies.
## Run Once and Then Forget
