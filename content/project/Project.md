[Detect ChatGPT]() | Under development
- With the help of ChatGPT, you can easily copy and paste assignments and all kinds of things.
- So to detect this, I have created a project called **Detect ChatGPT**. Using NLP techniques, I trained and deployed a model to detect text generated by ChatGPT.
- The project is under development and will soon be ready to be deployed.


[EV Cyber Attack Detection](/Project/ev-cyber-detection/) | Under development
- With the power of the SVM model, I can detect a false data injection attack in an EV station. To make this work, you need data, and I have created a dataset to match the requirements of the research paper.
- This model is very powerful, and the theory behind it is provided in this [research paper](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Cyber-Attack-Detection/blob/main/Research%20Paper/Cyber-Attack_on_P2P_Energy_Transaction_Between_Connected_Electric_Vehicles_A_False_Data_Injection_Detection_Based_Machine_Learning_Model-1.pdf).
