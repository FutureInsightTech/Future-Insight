[Cyber Attack Detection on EV Station](/cyber-attack-detection/) | Under development
- With the power of the SVM model, I can detect a false data injection attack in an EV station. To make this work, you need data, and I have created a dataset to match the requirements of the research paper.
- This model is very powerful, and the theory behind it is provided in this [research paper](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Cyber-Attack-Detection/blob/main/Research%20Paper/Cyber-Attack_on_P2P_Energy_Transaction_Between_Connected_Electric_Vehicles_A_False_Data_Injection_Detection_Based_Machine_Learning_Model-1.pdf).

[Set-Up](/Gnome-Setup/) | 19th March 2020
- I work as a developer, and sometimes your computer gets messed up and you have to reinstall the operating system, but it takes hours to configure the system to your needs.

- Run it and then forget it.
