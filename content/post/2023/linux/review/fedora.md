I have been using Linux for a long time, and I switch Linux distros time by time to see what is going on in the world of Linux. I used Debian for a while, then switched to Arch, and the cycle goes on and on with no stop. I have never used Fedora, so I thought, "Why not? Let's try Fedora and see what's the hype?" Why people love Fedora so much and what it is like to run Fedora for a while

# Review
In this blog, I will give my review of Fedora 38. So I have divided this blog into four main sections.
1. Installing the Operating System
2. Installing Applications
3. System stability
4. Performace

During my time with Fedora 38, I will be noting and testing everything that comes with it.






# Conclusion:
With that, we will see you next time.❤️❤️
