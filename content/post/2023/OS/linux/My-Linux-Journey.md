Embarking on my Linux journey during my student days as a budding software engineer, I eagerly dove into Linux distro videos and blog posts. However, despite my efforts, the seemingly elusive task of installing Linux and setting up dual boot with Windows remained an enigma.

# My Linux Journey
## The Dual Boot Dilemma

As a newcomer to the world of computers, I grappled with the concept of dual booting and sought help from a tech-savvy friend. Faced with a barrage of questions, his response was simple: "Google it."

## Initiating with Ubuntu 18.04

My initial foray into the Linux realm commenced with Ubuntu 18.04. Armed with a Dell Inspiron 15, I successfully orchestrated a dual boot setup with Windows 10. The allure of customization and aesthetics within Ubuntu's environment captured my imagination.

## Navigating the Terrain of Linux Applications

As I delved deeper, the limitations of Linux applications within my university's predominantly Windows ecosystem became evident. Struggling to install applications, I conquered Google Chrome but remained perplexed by the process for others.

## The Ubuntu 19.04 Upgrade Fiasco

Eager to keep up with the latest version, I attempted an upgrade to Ubuntu 19.04 via GUI. Disaster struck, leaving me with a broken system. My friend's support was limited this time, leading me to realize that self-reliance was the key.

## Conquering the Command Line

A novice in terminal usage, I was apprehensive about the command line. Through diligent watching of instructional videos and practice, I conquered my fear and began to master the terminal's intricacies.

## Snap Packages and the Birth of the "Application Installer" Project

Snap packages provided a solution for application installation, but I aspired for more. Creating the "Application Installer" project on GitHub allowed me to automate installations with a single click, fostering my passion for Bash shell scripting.

## The Fascination of Distro Hopping

Exploring different distros like POP OS, Debian, and Arch, I developed a nuanced understanding of each. Eventually, Debian and Arch emerged as the front-runners, embodying stability and customization respectively.

## The Path to Perfect Customization

Striving for a personalized desktop environment, I honed my customization skills with Gnome. Delving into titling window managers, I experimented with Awesome, Hyperland, BSPWM, and others, before settling on Awesome Window Manager.

## The Transformative Impact

This Linux journey has molded me into a resilient developer, imparting lessons that extend far beyond technology. It has taught me patience, problem-solving, and the beauty of community-driven learning.

## The Love-Hate Relationship with Arch

Embracing Arch Linux, I confronted its notorious installation process. Determined to master it, I undertook the challenge, and while it tested my patience, it also provided a thorough education on Linux systems.

## The Zen of the Terminal

With newfound confidence, I embraced the terminal as a powerful tool. I began scripting not only for application installations but also for system configurations, automating tasks that once seemed daunting.

## Pinnacle of Customization

My fascination with window managers led me to Awesome Window Manager. I curated a workspace that married productivity with aesthetic appeal, transforming my screen into an efficient and visually captivating space.

# Conclusion: The Irreversible Shift to Linux Magic

With each challenge and triumph, my Linux journey has been an inexorable path of growth. Once you plunge into the Linux realm, the enchantment of its open-source world becomes an irresistible force that forever alters your perspective. From conquering the command line to crafting a personalized environment, the journey is as transformative as it is rewarding.

## A Call to Fellow Developers: Embrace the Linux Odyssey

To my fellow developers, I extend a challenge: embrace Linux on your own machine. The initial hurdles are a small price for the empowerment and mastery that await. As I reflect on my journey, I'm reminded that Linux is not just an operating system; it's a philosophy that nurtures both technical prowess and a growth mindset.

## Epilogue: The Ongoing Expedition

As I write these closing words, I'm not concluding my journey but rather reflecting on its ongoing nature. Linux has become an integral part of my life, propelling me forward in my career and personal growth. So, if you're a developer contemplating the Linux path, take the leap, embrace the challenges, and let the Linux magic unfold before you. Your journey awaits.


With that, we will see you next time.❤️❤️
