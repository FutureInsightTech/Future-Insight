## Chatbots
There are so many chatbat that are being developed but all of these chatbot have one thing in common that they are all are using chatgpt under the hood, they have the data.
they are training chatgpt using the api and training to suite there needs. 

The best place to start is the category that brought AI to the mainstream. AI chatbots allow you to chat with an AI large language model, letting you ask questions and get answers in a conversational style. The best chatbots use advanced reasoning and logic, write code, and make mathematical calculations.

### Chatgpt
ChatGPT is the current industry leader, and the first chatbot that set the scene on fire. It's powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, and it's surprisingly flexible and very easy to use. Learn how to use ChatGPT, understand how it works, and discover how to use it to write marketing copy, do market research, or write sales emails.

### HuggingChat
[HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/) is the open source alternative, receiving contributions from many developers on Hugging Face, the collaborative AI platform. I've found that the accuracy isn't as high as the two mentioned above, but it's interesting to see how it feels by comparison.

you can use AI models as a co-writer, helping you put together first drafts faster.

### Anyword
Anyword helps marketers create content by breaking the generation process down step by step. First, you add your prompt to generate a few titles. Then, you can pick your favorite and see a generated outline. Once you tweak that outline to what you want to cover, you can move forward to generating the final piece.

## Grammar Checkers
Spell-checking has been around for a long time, but AI is changing the game. Before, it only detected spelling and basic structure errors. Now, it can spot tone and complex language and offer suggestions to make your writing clearer.
