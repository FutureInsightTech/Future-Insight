# Introduction:
I'm a developer, and I have been developing applications for a while, but with time, I have seen that my skills are increasing, but every time I learn something new, I forget the old thing.

I do make notes, but writing with my hands is not a great solution, so I decided to blog, but the question is, where? So I decided to try a different blogging website and a couple of note-taking applications.

Such as Medium or Notion, but these are great, but I didn't get the feel of writing blogs, and to be honest, the writing experience was just okay on Medium and Notion.

I love Markdown; it's flexible and works like a champ. I have been using markdown for something like three months, and I wanted some place where I could post my blogs in markdown.

Hey! What I'm thinking is that I am a developer; I can build a blogging website. It will be easy, and I can do whatever I want with it.

# Exiting Solutions
So I went online and started looking for existing solutions, and boy, did I find a lot of them, but they are either very time-consuming or lack the feature that I was looking for.

When I was researching for blog website, I have to make a couple of key choices that was, which technologies I will be using to develop and code my application, 

So before that, I need to decide whether I need a dynamic website or a static website since I want to post just blogs on my website, so I will go with a static website. There are a few good reasons to go with a static website, such as speed and ease of configuration and coding. Because I don't have time to build a dynamic website, I'm going with a static website, but you can choose your own framework, such as React, Angular, or any other framework.

Not just a any static website, I need a way to post blogs without creating an admin dashboard and this was super important, I am trying to avoid an entire full system. 

So after searching like a lot I came across something called **HUGO**. 

# Desired characteristics:
